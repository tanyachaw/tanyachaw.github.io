            <h2>August 13th</h2>
            <h4>8/13/24</h4>
            <p>
            
            The key to a successful bargain is not wanting the product. 
            Even if you do, you don’t. See a thing, like it, set an upper 
            limit. Make sure it’s reasonable. Go to the person selling it 
            and just plainly present what you like. Then, after they tell you 
            how much it is, tell them your upper limit. Thank them when and if they succumb. <br><br>

            I saw an outdoor thrift store somewhere in Manhattan. I didn’t expect to like 
            anything, but I ended up liking two skirts - a pink and a floral number. A white 
            top too. All three of which were realistically worth 20 dollars. The lady selling 
            them, Riza, told me the top was 35, the pink skirt was 30, and the floral was 40. 
            Atrocious, but I didn’t say that to Riza. I told her I’ll take both skirts for 50. 
            She countered with 55. I stared at the pink skirt. “Let me think about it,” I said. 
            Took 3 minutes. I told her I’d just do the floral for 30. 
            She succumbed and told me to take both for 50. Then she took a picture of me 
            for their instagram story - they do this for all customers, I wasn’t special 
            (although still flattered). <br><br>

            I never thought I could bargain. I grew up seeing my mom and 
            grandmother bargain in India, which looked like the vendor saying 50 and them 
            insulting the vendor, saying that his eggplant is rotten (edit: I chose the wrong example vegetable)
            and thus is worth 5. 
            I liked when the vendors hit back with the “ok don’t buy it then.” But almost 
            every time, my mother figures got a good deal. I never understood how. But I guess 
            I’m learning. <br><br>

            Elderberry stems are toxic. I guess the berries are too, I don’t know. 
            So you have very limited options of what to do with elderberries. I made a syrup, 
            which took two hours to cook down and left me with, let’s see, a tablespoon. <br><br>

            I’ve tried explaining recursion to exactly three people in my life and 
            failed every single time to convey how absolutely mind-blowing it is. What I 
            love the most about it is that it’s a mathematical concept about trust. 
            You have to blindly trust so many moving parts - it breaks your brain if you 
            try to understand how it works. And yet it works. It’s the closest thing to witchcraft I’ve 
            seen in math. <br><br>

            All I will do is try to explain it the way I learned it - through the Fibonacci problem.<br><br>

            The Fibonacci sequence is named after a dude. He was Italian. In the sequence, 
            each number is a sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 
            34, 55, etc. etc. Hopefully you see it. <br><br>

            We want to write an algorithm that gives us the nth Fibonacci number. 
            That is, we want to tell the program, hey give me the 6th Fibonacci number, 
            and it’s supposed to give us 8. Similarly we can say give us the 2nd number, 
            and it’s supposed to give us 1. <br><br>

            We solve this problem through recursion. Here’s the 
            outline of a recursive solution courtesy 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GG22dJyh85zENV-YJirBn8U7moXVKhzXjrT5PcfrfOk/edit#slide=id.g2e93efb9d70_0_1">CS 10 slides</a>: <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Base case(s)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What’s the simplest or smallest case?</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Recursive case</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Divide the problem into smaller parts.</li>
                        <li>Invoke the function on each part (recursively).</li>
                        <li>Combine parts into a total solution.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

            Let’s blindly trust the outline and build a solution in code. 
            First just define the inputs and outputs the program will take. 
            The input is a number anywhere from 1 to infinity. The output is a 
            number anywhere from 0 to infinity given that it shows up in the Fibonacci sequence. <br><br>

            Base case: if the input is negative or 0, end the program. That’s BS. 
            A person shouldn't ask for a negative or zero-th Fibonacci number.<br><br>

            Base case: If the input is 1, return 0. 0 is the first Fibonacci number. Remember, simplest case. <br><br>

            Base case 3: If the input is 2, return 1. Another simple case!<br><br>

            Recursive case (PREPARE YOURSELF): if none of the above cases apply, return the 
            sum of the last and second to last Fibonacci numbers. Notice this is literally just the definiton
            of the sequence. Put mathematically, we tell 
            the computer to return the outcome of this very program ran on (the input - 1) + 
            (the input - 2). AND JUST TRUST THAT IT WORKS. AND IT DOES. <br><br>

            Here it is in code:<br>

            <pre><code>
                def Fibonacci(n):
                    if n <= 0:
                        print("Incorrect input")
                    # First Fibonacci number is 0
                    elif n == 1:
                        return 0
                    # Second Fibonacci number is 1
                    elif n == 2:
                        return 1
                    else:
                        return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)  
                    </code></pre>

                    I miss math. It provided a nice balance in life. 
                    I could be a frustrated person in Pro Tools or a google doc 
                    where there would be no right answer and when the frustration 
                    would become too much, I could go back to a Jupyter notebook or my 
                    iPad where there would indeed be one right answer. You either get it or 
                    you don’t. True or False. 1 or 0. I long for that unambiguity.
                    I want to explain recursion to someone over and over again until I figure 
                    out the best way to get the point across. <br><br>

                    Ira Glass once said “there are no guilty pleasures, only pleasures.” 
                    He is somewhat right and somewhat wrong. I have guilty pleasures. 
                    Nut butter for one. Peanut butter was invented in 1884. The National 
                    Peanut Board says that there is evidence of ancient South American Incas 
                    being the first to grind peanuts to a paste. I don’t have a citation for this so don't trust it. 
                    There are a few people who invented peanut butter, 
                    but let’s just focus on one. In 1895, John Harvey Kellogg, yes that dude, 
                    patented the peanut butter making process and marketed it as a protein 
                    substitute for people who couldn’t chew. Which sounds like a skit. 
                    He boiled the peanuts instead of roasting them. It was initially 
                    for the wealthy and then became popular at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, 
                    a health resort and spa, for you know, the protein-starved people who couldn’t chew. <br><br>
                    
                    The initial peanut butters seem to be just roasted peanuts and oil. 
                    Skippy made “Chunky” peanut butter. Procter and Gamble made Jif, 
                    which was the first brand to add sugar and molasses to (and thus ruin) the product.<br><br>

                    I want to switch gears to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a second. 
                    Here's a beautiful <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/peanut-butter-and-jelly-history">article</a> about the history of the PB & J. Originally when 
                    peanut butter came on the scene, it was paired with things like pickles, mayo,
                    tomatos, celery, hard-boiled eggs, green peppers and maraschino cherries. 
                    In 1901, the first recipe for a PB & J appeared in the Boston Cooking School 
                    Magazine, which recommended pairing peanut butter with currant or crab apple 
                    jelly. I have an emotional relationship with this sandwich. It hits at a tender part of 
                    my childhood, but something I dropped from my diet as I grew older. I miss it, 
                    though I can’t imagine willingly making one for myself today. And it’s not just me - 
                    an average American child will eat around 1500 PB & J’s before graduating from 
                    high school (courtesy this <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/brief-history-peanut-butter-180976525/">article</a>). <br><br>

                    This is one of the best bits of peanut butter history. During Covid, 
                    Dana Small from Yale was trying to figure out a smell to use to test for 
                    asymptomatic carriers. She thought about it, asked herself and her team 
                    “what food most people in the U.S. have in their cupboards that provides a strong, 
                    familiar odor?” You guessed it. PEANUT BUTTER. Everyone who couldn’t smell peanut 
                    butter later tested positive for Covid. <br><br>

                    I've always wondered why dark chocolate felt like a hug in a food. 
                    Turns out, if this Cleveland Clinic <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/dark-chocolate-health-benefits">article</a> is to be trusted, 
                    it’s because of things called polyphenolic compounds. They’re antioxidants 
                    that lower cortisol levels. This feels like a simplification. <br><br>

                    Here’s a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955286321002746">study</a> testing dark chocolate and mood improvement. 
                    They tested three groups, one who consumed 85% cocoa chocolate, 
                    70% cocoa chocolate, and no chocolate. Turns out the 85% group saw a 
                    significant improvement in mood but the 70% didn’t! Gah! I must switch 
                    percentages! Damnit! (edit: I did, 85 is as satiating as 70, just a tad more bitter) 
                    Compared to the no chocolate group, the 85ers had more microbial diversity, their 
                    blautia obeum levels were elevated (it’s a bacteria in the gut but I have no idea what it does). 
                    There was a negative correlation between negative emotional states and blautia obeum levels, 
                    which is a complicated way of saying more blautia obeum is correlated with better moods. 
                    It may be concluded that 85% cocoa chocolate may improve mood through the gut-brain axis. <br><br>

                    The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network between the central (read brain) 
                    and enteric (read gut) nervous system. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/">THIS IS FASCINATING.</a> It links central nervous disorders - 
                    anxiety, autism, depression - to functional gastrointestinal disorders - IBS, low appetite, 
                    constipation etc. Pay attention to your stomach! Everything’s linked.  <br><br>

                    I’ve been meaning to write about the central nervous system (CNS) and how it stores the past in our bodies. 
                    Also the <a href="https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/triune-brain/">triune brain model</a> or the proposed model of the three parts of our brains - 
                    limbic, reptilian, and neocortex. The reptilian is the oldest brain - it tells us we’re hungry 
                    or about to be killed. The limbic gives us emotions and fucks us all up. The neocortex helps with 
                    learning, thinking, writing, and absorbing information. It’s the newest brain. <br><br>

                    I’ll end with this. I’m not sure how to describe Prospect Heights other than saying 
                    it is one of the best places I’ve ever lived. I lost a yoga mat and hence a little light in life, 
                    and found a beautiful one the next day someone kept outside on the street. 
                    I’ve picked up books, New Yorker magazines, and a white board too. It’s the best at 6am because you can 
                    smell the za'atar bagels outside the old Brooklyn bagel company. 
                    And best after sunset because the harsh sun left and now you can walk to 
                    Vanderbilt Avenue in the most gorgeous weather known to mankind. Prospect park is a 10 minute 
                    walk away. A solid yoga place is a 3 minute walk away. A gym is 7. People say good morning to you. 
                    It seems like everyone who lives here has kids or is pregnant or is 
                    reading the book pictured below. Manhattan’s fascinating, of course. But so far it just can’t compare. <br><br>
