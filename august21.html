            <h2>August 21st in New York</h2>
            <h4>8/21/24</h4>
            <p>
            
                It’s 5pm which means I don’t have a brain anymore. This city is getting to me. 
                What’s the city part of New York? 
                Is New York City both Manhattan and Brooklyn or just Manhattan? 
                How do people  maintain sanity in Manhattan?  <br><br>

                I went to get a haircut. Two people were in the shop - an attendant and a barber. 
                The barber was sweet, the attendant was clearly exhausted and had an attitude. 
                Luckily for me, I went to school in Delhi for three years so I’m equipped to handle people 
                with attitudes - the trick is to let them be. Unless of course their attitude spills on you. <br><br>
                
                After my split ends were chopped off, I went up to the counter to pay. The attendant and I stared at each other. “How are you paying?” he asked. I showed him my 
                phone. He signaled with his finger for me to come around the counter and tap my phone. I stood 
                there looking at him. Then he signaled again and said, in a more aggressive tone, “come around.”<br><br>
                
                But listen, I just got a blowout. A blowout. I don’t have split ends anymore. 
                Did he see my hair? “You could be nicer about it,” I said, while coming around. 
                I said it like he was a childhood friend and I had 
                grown sullen because of his irrational acting up. He told me he didn’t want to take my phone from me. I told him he still 
                could’ve been politer about it. “I’m sorry,” he said, and then became chivalrous. <br><br>
                
                The misfits bar company messed up misfits bars! I loved misfits bars to no end 
                in the spring before taking a break from them. They were calling me after work so I 
                walked to Trader Joe's to get two, “new and improved.” I walked to 
                Washington Square park to eat one. An Italian guy was singing Frank Sinatra. <br><br>
                
                I cried in Washington Square Park once. I sat on a bench, watched a girl 
                roller skate, and cried for an hour. One time, I sat there with a thirty-dollar 
                bagel when a man tried to persuade me to convert to Christianity on camera. 
                Another time, I sat waiting in the evening when a man came up to me to ask if 
                I wanted to grab drinks, and when I refused, he asked if it was because he was ugly. <br><br>
                
                The misfits bar lacked all the magic the original misfits cookie butter bar had. 
                I ate it in disappointment. <br><br>
                
                The green figs at Trader Joe’s are killing it though. 
                I stood on the subway platform and pulled one out with Raynaud’s Sydrome hands, so I couldn’t actually 
                feel the fig. I was lucky enough to grow up in a house 
                that had a huge fig tree in the backyard. Nothing matches those figs -  
                they will melt in your hands, but these are the closest dupe I've found. <br><br>
                
                I met a lady at the gym who offered me advice on hip thrusts and then a slot in her 
                soccer league. They’re called the Pizza Rats and need women. I’m terrible at 
                soccer but it’s one of those things I’ve always wanted to try. Also aerial silks. <br><br>
                
                My favorite part of the week is Saturday morning because I get to walk to the 
                Grand Army Plaza Farmers Market. There’s a lady named Jessica over there who sells 
                juice. She’s great. This last weekend, she asked me what color label looked better on the beet juice bottle - 
                lavender or orange. Lavender. I was in the process of paying her when a man showed up 
                and picked up my bottle to look at the juice. He twirled the bottle around 
                in his fingers, touched it all over, and then put it back. I didn’t even need to say anything and 
                Jessica pulled out another bottle for me. Feminine intuition! In action! <br><br>
                
                I live in a place that has homemade art in it; it has lamps, good books, good cookbooks, 
                labeled spice jars, colored dumbbells, tea bags, 
                flowers, cast iron skillets. <br><br>

                In the evening, the brownstones light up from the inside. 
                I'll see bookshelves, pianos, plants, cats, sofas in golden orbs.
                What’s most alluring is the light. 
                It goes back to our hunter gatherer days, fire was associated with warmth. 
                Warmth was associated with survival, safety. So naturally we gravitate towards things 
                that look and feel like fire.<br><br>
                
                Granted that you do not have control over a bad day, 
                you absolutely have control over coming home, showering, lighting 
                candles, making dinner, making some dandelion root tea (which will 
                change your life) and walking to the store to get some 85% dark chocolate. 
                Take advantage of it.<br><br>
