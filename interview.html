            <h2>The Interview</h2>
            <h4>1/3/25</h4>
            <p>
                "Most men and women lead lives, if not of quiet
                desperation, at least of desperate quietness, and they jump at a chance to talk
                about their work to an outsider who seems eager to listen."

                <br><br>

                My first interview was god awful. I kept wanting to jump in with my next question 
                on the list without listening to the answer of the previous one. Luckily you 
                relax as you keep interviewing, because ultimately the thing you need is acceptance, 
                genuine interest, and some good listening skills. 

                <br><br>

                We can’t change people, but we want to. We want to mend them to suit us. 
                A nice part of interviewing or profiling someone is that it’s in the job to accept 
                them as they are, to learn who they are. There’s no incentive to form a relationship 
                with them, so there’s no incentive to judge them. It's a discovery. And that’s 
                the thing. In all our relationships, we have a hard time accepting people as they 
                are, with their quirks and oddities. But in an interview, those oddities make this 
                person who they are, and we appreciate them. 

                <br><br>

                Acceptance
                One way to accept other people is to accept yourself. Start to view yourself 
                objectively, as opposed to personalizing everything. Then it gets easier to do 
                the same with other people. 

                <br><br>

                Genuine interest
                There’s this thing about “good talkers,” people who just sound so good on 
                tape because of their way of talking. There’s something so unabashedly authentic 
                about them that it leaks on the phone. Or maybe they’re talking about something that 
                really gets them riled up. I once spoke to a philosophy major turned Michelin star 
                chef who had a lot to say about life. It’s those people you’re looking for. 

                <br><br>
