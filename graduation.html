            <h2>Graduation (a photo essay)</h2>
            <h4>5/11/24</h4>
            <p>
                After four years of sheer trauma and tumult, I graduated from UC Berkeley. I feel like 
                I just went through war. I took FIVE final exams last week. FIVE. FIVE. And the last 
                one was from 7pm to 10pm on a class I DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THIS SEMESTER. And now I have a 
                deep desire to be submerged in a body of water for a bit. <br><br>

                When I got into this school, I cried. 
                Throughout my four years here, I also cried. 
                Because of frustration, insecurities, happiness, hormone fluctuations, and yoga. 
                Several professors touched my life deeply. I told some of them, I didn’t tell others. <br><br>

                I made friends, lost friends, made acquaintances, lost acquaintances, 
                lost myself for a bit too, found myself again - or not, who the fuck knows. <br><br>

                During covid, I saw an article that said this school 
                will beat the shit out of you but you’ll come out stronger. 
                I think that’s largely true and applies to anyone who went here. At least 
                those who majored in something STEM and largely questioned their will to 
                live throughout their time here. We can all trauma bond. <br><br>

                I guess it wasn’t all bad. So here are some things I think I’ll miss. <br><br>

                Berkeley time<br><br>
                North Berkeley<br><br>
                Deers<br><br>
                The rays of sun in Doe<br><br>
                Cheeseboard pizza<br><br>
                This bench<br><br>
                The main stacks DS section<br><br>
                Moffit in the morning<br><br>
                Strada<br><br>
                ISAS events<br><br>
                This book box where I got the NYT every morning<br><br>
                This set of stairs that I ran up every morning<br><br>
                The RSF, oh my dear RSF<br><br>
                My Berkeley email account <br><br>
                Just looking at people be. I saw a girl riding her skateboard with her arms 
                flailing down a hill in near Grizzly Peak once
                and she looked like the most free person on the planet. Or how when it's sunny everyone
                just gathers on the glade. I'll miss how much authencity is unquestionably accepted here.
                The weirder you are the better.<br><br>
                The rare sights of seeing people read books in the gym or on the treadmill. <br><br>
